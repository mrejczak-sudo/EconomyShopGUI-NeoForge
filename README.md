# EconomyShopGUI - NeoForge 1.21.1 (Ready-to-build)

This archive contains a ready-to-build **source project** (Java) for NeoForge/Forge targeting **Minecraft 1.21.1**.
It contains a full port scaffold of the EconomyShopGUI plugin including:
- Vault-compatible API shim
- JSON-backed economy
- Shop loader (from YAML), Shop Menu (server) and Shop Screen (client)
- Commands: `/shop`, `/eshop reload`

## Important - required on your machine
- Java 21 JDK
- Internet connection (Gradle will download NeoForge/Forge artifacts and plugin)
- Gradle (the Gradle wrapper will be generated by the neoforged plugin on first run)

## Build
From project root:
```bash
# fetch dependencies and build
./gradlew build
# or on Windows
gradlew.bat build
```

The produced mod JAR will be in `build/libs/` once the build finishes.

If you want, you can use the included GitHub Actions workflow (not included here) to build on CI.
